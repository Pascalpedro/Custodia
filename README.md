## Introduction!!!

### Secure Flask Microservice: Robust and Scalable Web Service with Enhanced Security

In today's fast-paced digital economy, businesses face the pressing challenge of delivering secure, scalable, and responsive web services that can adapt to changing market demands. Introducing the Secure and Scalable Flask Microservice, a cutting-edge solution that combines the power of Flask, Docker, ngrok, and Auth0 to revolutionize the way you build and deploy your web-based applications.

As businesses strive to stay ahead of the competition, the need for a reliable and secure web service infrastructure has become increasingly critical. Our Secure and Scalable Flask Microservice addresses this crucial requirement by providing a comprehensive and scalable solution that can be tailored to the unique needs of your organization.

At the core of this project is a Flask-based web service, a lightweight and flexible Python framework that forms the backbone of the application's functionality. To ensure secure access to this service, we have integrated ngrok, a secure tunneling solution that creates an encrypted channel which allows controlled access to the web service. This approach safeguards your web service from direct exposure, shielding it from potential threats and enabling secure access for your users.

To further strengthen the security of our Secure Flask Microservice, we have incorporated Auth0, a leading identity and access management (IAM) platform. Auth0 handles user management, authentication, and authorization, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the application's features and data, providing an additional layer of protection for your business-critical information.

The Secure and Scalable Flask Microservice is built using Docker containerization, a technology that enables the efficient deployment and scaling of your web service across multiple environments. By containerizing the Flask app, we have created a highly portable and scalable solution that can be easily managed and deployed, allowing your business to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and user demands.

With the integration of Nginx as a reverse proxy and Gunicorn as the application server, we have implemented a robust and high-availability architecture that can handle increased traffic and ensure the seamless operation of your web service.

By combining these powerful components, we have created a Secure Flask Microservice that offers the following key benefits:

- **Secure Communication**: The ngrok tunneling service provides a secure, encrypted channel for accessing the Flask web service, protecting it from direct internet exposure.
- **Enhanced Security and Robust Authentication**: The secure VPN tunneling with ngrok, integration with Auth0 for user management and authentication, and the containerized and microservice-based architecture enhance the overall security posture of the web service, protecting it from potential threats and unauthorized access.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The Docker containerization of the Flask app, the Nginx load balancer, and the Gunicorn application server enable easy scaling and deployment of the web service across multiple environments, ensuring high availability and the ability to handle increased user traffic.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The use of Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python framework, the containerized and microservice-based architecture, and the ability to quickly scale and deploy the web service across different environments empower businesses to adapt to market changes and emerging requirements.
- **Improved Reliability and Maintainability**: The high-availability architecture, the modular and microservice-based design, and the containerized and automated deployment processes enhance the overall reliability and consistency of the web service, reducing the risk of downtime and simplifying the troubleshooting and debugging processes.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: The modular and microservice-based design, the containerization and automated deployment processes, and the reusability and portability of the containerized Flask app lead to cost savings by reducing the complexity of development, testing, and deployment, and streamlining the infrastructure management.

Whether you're a developer, a system administrator, or a business stakeholder, the Secure Flask Microservice project offers a reliable and secure foundation for your web-based applications.

## QUICK SETUP:


1. **Connect to the remote server**: From your local machine, SSH into the remote server using the provided username and password.

2. **Create a new user account**:
   - Set up the username and password using the below commands:

    ```bash
    sudo useradd -m $USERNAME
    sudo usermod -aG sudo $USERNAME 
    sudo passwd $USERNAME  
    ```

3. **Install Required Software**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update 
   sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose python3 python3-pip snapd screen  
   sudo apt install snapd
   sudo snap install ngrok  # ngrok can't be installed directly using the apt package manager on Ubuntu because it's not available in the Ubuntu official package repositories.
   ```

    - Alternatively, you can as well check the [**Ngrok Official Documentation**](https://ngrok.com/docs/guides/device-gateway/linux/) or [**Ngrok Setup & Installation**](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/linux) page to walk you through the process of installing the ngrok agent on a remote Linux device.

4. **Set Up Docker and Docker Compose**:
   - Enable and start Docker:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USERNAME
   newgrp docker
   ```

5. **Create a project directory (dir)**: 
   - Set up a dir to contain your scripts and configuration files and change the ownership of the dir to the current user.

    ```bash
    mkdir web_serv
    chown -R $USERNAME:$USERNAME /home/$USERNAME/web_serv
    cd _web_serv
    ```

6. **Set Up and Activate a Virtual Environment (env)**:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    apt install python3-virtualenv
    python3 -m venv flask_env
    source flask_env/bin/activate
    ```

7.  **Install Python packages and dependencies**:

      ```bash
      pip install package_name
      pip list
      pip freeze > requirements.txt  # to create a requirements.txt file, generate a list of all the installed libs, their versions and export them to the newly created file. 
      ```
    OR
    
    - You can append the list of the python packages needed inside a requirements.txt file and then install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.

### BUILDING THE CODE BLOCKS

1.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file with the necessary variables in your pjoject root dir.

2.  **Create a basic app.py script**:
    - Using a text editor, create an `app.py` which create a simple web application that returns a JSON response with a greeting message and the current timestamp.

        ```python
        from flask import Flask
        from gevent.pywsgi import WSGIServer
        from datetime import datetime

        app = Flask(__name__)

        @app.route('/')
        def hello():
            return {
                'message': 'Hello, Flask... This is Pascal!!!',
                'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
            }

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            # #Debug/Development
            # app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
            # Production
            http_server = WSGIServer(('', 5000), app)
            http_server.serve_forever()
        ``` 
    This above demonstrates the use of Flask for building a basic web application and the use of a high-performance WSGI server (gevent.pywsgi) for production deployment.

3. Create a `wsgi.py` file which will be used to       deploy the Flask application in a production-based environment and append the following:
    ```python
    from app import app

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

4.  Test the `app.py` script by running the below command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```
    To confirm that the app is up and running, launch your browser and go to either `localhost:5000`, `127.0.0.1:5000`, `Your_Server_IP:5000` or run the `curl command` below from the terminal:

     ```bash
        curl 127.0.0.1:5000
        curl $Your_Server_IP:5000
     ```
    
    **Note**: If you encountered any blocker, kindly analysis the error messages and log files for further information.

5.  **Set Up ngrok**:
    - Navigate to [**Ngrok Official Page**](https://ngrok.com/) and `sign up` for a new account.
    - Provide the required credentials and set up your account.
    - Login to your [Ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and click on `Your Authtoken` to copy out your personal token that will be used to authenticate the ngrok agent that you downloaded on your server.
    - In your terminal, input the below command:

        ```bash
        ngrok authtoken <auth_token>  # the $auth_token copied from above.
        ```

6.  **Run Flask App and ngrok in Screen Sessions**:
    - The `screen` app is a  terminal multiplexer, which allows you to create, access, and manage multiple independent terminal sessions within a single terminal window or remote SSH session. Although it's optional, but it provides a convenient way to manage and maintain the different components of your development setup, making it easier to work on and deploy your Flask application, especially when using a tunneling service like ngrok.

        ```bash
        screen -S flask
        python3 main.py
        # Press Ctrl+A, then D to detach

        screen -S ngrok
        ngrok http 5000
        # Press Ctrl+A, then D to detach
        ```

7.  **Spin-up Ngrok**:
- Serve the application via the ngrok ingress
    -  Fire up the ngrok agent and start a HTTP tunnel forwarding pointing to your flask app using:
  
        ```bash
        ngrok http 5000
        ```

    - Ngrok will serve the flask app via the URL listed by the ngrok agent, mapped to `Forwarding` in the ngrok terminal, e.g: [Forwarding URL](https://492b-2a01-7e01-00-f03c-95ff-fe50-61f2.ngrok-free.app), copy and paste into a web browser.
    - Click on the `Visit Site` button displaying on the webpage, verify that you can access the flask app service via ngrok secure tunnel.
    - The above ngrok generated url can be shared to trusted users with access to web browsers, to verify accessiblity of the flask app service via a secure tunneling solutions.

### CONTAINERIZATION

1.  -**Scaling with Docker**:
    - Create a `Dockerfile` script on your project root dir, where the flask script and requirements.txt files are located and append the below scripts:

        ```Dockerfile
        # Use a base image with the latest version of Python
        FROM python:3.9-slim

        # Set the working directory
        WORKDIR /app

        # A blueprint for installing necessary dependencies and libs
        COPY requirements.txt .

        # Install the required dependencies
        RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

        # Copy the Python script into the container
        COPY . .

        # Use Gunicorn to serve the Flask app and expose the port that the flask app will run on
        CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
        ```
    The overall purpose of this Dockerfile is to create a Docker image that can be used to run the Flask-based web application. The image will have the necessary Python dependencies installed, and the Flask application will be served using the Gunicorn web server.

2.  -**Building the Docker image**:
    - Verify that your `pwd` is the dir where your `Dockerfile` `app.py` and `requirements.txt` files are located, and build the flask image using the below:

        ```bash
        docker build -t flask_app .
        ```

3.  -**Running the Docker image**:
    - Run the container that was created based on your `flask_app` image:

        ```bash
        docker images  # to verify that the image is in your repo
        docker run -p 5000:5000 flask_app
        ```

    And you now have an optimized Flask server running in a Docker container.

    You should be able to check it in your Docker container's URL, for example: <a href="Your_Server_IP" target="_blank">http://Your_Server_IP:5000</a> or <a href="http://127.0.0.1" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:5000</a>


4. - Follow the same procedure used with `Ngrok` similarly to when we deployed the service directly using the python command and verify that you can access the flask app service via Ngrok secure VPN tunnel.

### INTEGRATING WITH EXTERNAL USER MANAGEMENT


1. **Setting Up Auth0**:
    - For the external authentication and user management system integration with the VPN tunneling solution, let's use `Auth0 authentication` because of it's seamless compactibility with Ngrok.
    - Navigate to [**Auth0 Official Page**](https://auth0.com/signup/) and `sign up` for a new Auth0 account.
    - From the Auth0 Administrative Dashboard, click **Applications** > **Applications,** and then click **Create Application**.
    - On the Create application popup, enter **ngrok oidc** as the application name, select the **Single Page Web Application** tile, and then click **Create**.
    - On the ngrok app page, click the Settings tab and copy the `Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret` values, to be used later.
    - Enter the URLs `https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback` `http://*.ngrok-free.app/callback` in the **Allowed Callback URLs** field, and enter the URLs `https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2` `http://*.ngrok-free.app` in the **Allowed Logout URLs** field. Also for security checks, enter the URLs `https://idp.ngrok.com` `http://*.ngrok-free.app` in your **Allowed Web Origins** field.

2.  - Return to the root directory of the project in the terminal and create a `.env` file and pass in the following parameters:

        ```plaintext
        AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_auth0_client-id
        AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your_auth0_client_secret
        AUTH0_DOMAIN=your_auth0_client_secret
        APP_SECRET_KEY= # generated using a secure random number generator
        ```

        - To generate the `APP_SECRET_KEY`, use the secure random number generator provided by default in the machine by running this command:
            ```bash
            openssl rand -hex 32
            ```
3.  - Launch the ngrok application again, and fire up a `HTTP Ngrok tunnel` using the below command, replacing `AUTH0_OAUTH_URL` with the domain copied from Auth0, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` with the client id from Auth0, and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` with the client secret copied from Auth0:

        ```bash
        ngrok http 5000 --oidc=AUTH0_OAUTH_URL \--oidc-client-id=AUTH0_CLIENT_ID \--oidc-client-secret=AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
        ```
4.  - Copy the URL available next to forwarding and launch your app. You will be redirected for authentication with Auth0.

5.  - Sign up with a new account and complete the authentication and gain secured access to the `flask_app` web service.

---
### ADD LOGIN TO THE FLASK APPLICATION!!!

Auth0 makes it possible to add authentication to the Flask web application and gain access to user profile information built with the Flask framework and Authlib OAuth library.

1.  **Install python dependencies**:
    - Append the following python libs to your `requirements.txt` file:
        ```bash
        flask>=2.0.3
        python-dotenv>=0.19.2
        authlib>=1.0
        requests>=2.27.1
        ```
    - Run the following command from your terminal to enable these dependencies in your project:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
2.  **Setup your Flask app with the Auth0 parameters**:
    - Import all the libs required by your flask application.
    - Load your `.env` file that was initially created.
    - Configure Authlib to handle your application's authentication with Auth0 using the `oauth.register()` function.
    - In the flask-app python script, append the `python dependencies`, and the four `auth0 routes` into the scripts. The four routes are:
        - `/login` route used to direct visitors to the Auth0 login page.
        - `/callback` route saves the session for the user and bypasses the need for them to login again when they return.
        - `/logout` route used to sign users out from the application.
        - `/home` route renders an authenticated user's details or allows vistors to sign in.

    - After appending the **auth0 functions()** to the existing `app.py` script or creating an entire new `app.py` script and renaming the previous one with another name to avoid conflict, your new `app.py` script should have the below contents:
      ```py
      import json
        from os import environ as env
        from urllib.parse import quote_plus, urlencode

        from authlib.integrations.flask_client import OAuth
        from dotenv import find_dotenv, load_dotenv
        from flask import Flask, redirect, render_template, session, url_for


        ENV_FILE = find_dotenv()
        if ENV_FILE:
            load_dotenv(ENV_FILE)

        app = Flask(__name__)
        app.secret_key = env.get("APP_SECRET_KEY")

        oauth = OAuth(app)

        oauth.register(
            "auth0",
            client_id=env.get("AUTH0_CLIENT_ID"),
            client_secret=env.get("AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET"),
            client_kwargs={
                "scope": "openid profile email",
            },
            server_metadata_url=f'https://{env.get("AUTH0_DOMAIN")}/.well-known/openid-configuration'
        )


        @app.route("/login")
        def login():
            return oauth.auth0.authorize_redirect(
                redirect_uri=url_for("callback", _external=True)
            )

        @app.route("/callback", methods=["GET", "POST"])
        def callback():
            token = oauth.auth0.authorize_access_token()
            session["user"] = token
            return redirect("/")

        @app.route("/logout")
        def logout():
            session.clear()
            return redirect(
                "https://" + env.get("AUTH0_DOMAIN")
                + "/v2/logout?"
                + urlencode(
                    {
                        "returnTo": url_for("home", _external=True),
                        "client_id": env.get("AUTH0_CLIENT_ID"),
                    },
                    quote_via=quote_plus,
                )
            )

        @app.route("/")
        def home():
            return render_template(
                "home.html",
                session=session.get('user'))
        #        pretty=json.dumps(session.get('user'), indent=4))


        if __name__ == "__main__":
            app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=env.get("PORT", 5000))  
        ```


3.  **Add templates**:
    - Create a sub-dir in your project root folder named `templates` and create a `home.html` file in the dir.
    - Append the following html script into the `home.html` file:
      ```html
      <html>
        <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Auth0 Example</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        {% if session %}
            <h1>Welcome {{session.userinfo.name}}!</h1>
            <p><a href="/logout">Logout</a></p>
        {% else %}
            <h1>Welcome Guest</h1>
            <p><a href="/login">Login</a></p>
        {% endif %}
        </body>
        </html>
        ```


4.  **Re-build the Docker image**:
    - Rebuild the Docker image to sync and reflect with the modified `app.py` script using the:
        ```bash
        docker build -t flask_auth0 .
        ```

    **Running the Docker image**:
    - Run the container that was created based on your `flask_auth0` image:

        ```bash
        docker images  # to verify that the image is in your repo
        docker run -p 5000:5000 flask_auth0
        ```

    And you now have an optimized Flask server embedded with **auth0 authentication** parameters running in a Docker container.


5. **Spin-up Ngrok**:
   - Serve the application via the ngrok ingress and start a HTTP tunnel forwarding pointing to your `flask_auth0` docker container using:
  
        ```bash
        ngrok http 5000
        ```

    - Ngrok will serve the `flask_auth0` docker container via the URL listed by the ngrok agent, mapped to `Forwarding` in the ngrok terminal, e.g: [Forwarding URL](https://492b-2a01-7e01-00-f03c-95ff-fe50-61f2.ngrok-free.app).
    -  Copy the URL available next to forwarding and launch your app. You will be redirected for authentication with Auth0.
    - Click on the `Visit Site` button displaying on the webpage.
   - Sign up with a new account and complete the authentication and gain secured access to the `flask_app` web service.

    -  Verify that you can access the `flask_auth0` service embedded with **auth0 user authenticationa and management** via ngrok secure tunnel.
    - The above ngrok generated url can be shared to users with access to web browsers, to create accounts and have access to the flask app service via a secure tunneling solutions.

### LOAD BALANCING!!!

**Nginx**: a powerful and widely-used web server that can also function as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache.

Let's integrate Nginx with our `Secure Flask Microservice` app to create a more robust, scalable, and secure web application infrastructure. Nginx's flexibility and efficiency make it a popular choice for hosting and managing web applications, especially in production environments.

- Create an nginx configuration file called `nginx.conf` in your project root dir and append the below scripts:
    ```plain
    upstream web_servers {
        least_conn;
        server $Your_Server_IP:5000;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name your-app.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://web_servers;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
    ```
- Modify your Dockerfile to allow Nginx to act as the load balancer, forwarding incoming requests to the multiple instances of the Flask application using the below script:
    ```Dockerfile
    # Use a base image with the latest version of Python
    FROM python:3.9-slim

    # Set the working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # A blueprint for installing necessary dependencies and libs
    COPY requirements.txt .

    # Install the required dependencies
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Copy the Python script into the container
    COPY . .

    # Use Nginx as the load balancer and Gunicorn to serve the Flask app and expose the port that the flask app will run on
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
    COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    CMD ["bash", "-c", "nginx -g 'daemon off;' & gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app"]
    ```
    **Re-build the Docker image**:
    - Rebuild the Docker image to sync and reflect with the modified `app.py` script using the:
        ```bash
        docker build -t flask_auth0_nginx .
        ```

    **Running the Docker image**:
    - Run the container that was created based on your `flask_auth0` image:

        ```bash
        docker images  # to verify that the image is in your repo
        docker run -p 5000:5000 flask_auth0
        ```

    And you now have an **`optimized Flask server` embedded with `auth0` authentication parameters, with `Nginx` server acting as a load balancer** running in a `Docker` container.
